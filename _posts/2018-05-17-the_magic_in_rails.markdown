Working on my first Rails project proved to be more challenging than I expected. Some people say that Rails works like magic, but as we all know there is no such thing as real magic. Every magic is a trick that has a method behind it and so does Rails, itâ€™s a collection of methods and conventions that give you powerful tools to create complex applications in minimum time. Much like a magician that needs to study and practice to perfect his craft, it takes time to learn and understand the methods behind the magic in order to execute it successfully. 

I decided for this project to create an app called Eventime. It is a social network for events. Users can add new locations for events which other users can then schedule events in (think a bar or a restaurant owner publishing his place and then other users can create events in that location and share with their friends). 

When I sat down to design the structure and code of the app I realized that in order to use the power of Rails in the best way I would need to really understand the logic and reason behind the methods. Even though it took me longer than expected this project had been a great learning opportunity and really solidified my understanding of Rails.
