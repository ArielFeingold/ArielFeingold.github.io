**“Hello World!”** This sentence is the first thing I actually coded right in the beginning of my web development course so it’s only fitting that this will be the first thing on my first blog post. On this post I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and what brought me to learn web development.

When I look back, it surprises me that I didn’t decide to learn to code until now.  I’ve always been the type who loved puzzles and enjoyed figuring out solutions to problems - the type of person who enjoyed the journey to arriving at a solution just as much or even more than arriving at the solution itself.  But it wasn’t until recently that I realized that working as a developer would be the ideal outlet for me to channel my passion for solving puzzles in a role that would allow me to comfortably support my family.

I grew up in Tel Aviv and began working in our family catering business.  Once I finished my military service and began to think about what I’d like to do with my life, my mother suggested that with my interest in solving problems (and, sometimes, enjoying arguments and debates) I should go to law school.  I began to study law but over time it became clear to me that practicing law was not my calling.  I had a friend at an online foreign exchange trading platform that was looking for a marketing operations manager.  Knowing that I was good at picking things up quickly and I had a lot of operations experience (from my experience in events), he convinced his company to take me on.  I really enjoyed coordinating cross-functional teams and working together to optimize different online campaigns.  It was really great to work with our developers to help them design code to create campaigns and develop a roadmap for our UX.  This was my first real exposure to working with programmers, and it occurred to me that I would probably love to work in a developer role, if only I had the skills… That’s when I decided to go back to school and learn web development.

You may ask yourself what I found so exiting about coding. Well, there are a few aspects of it that makes it the best fit for me:

**Coding is ever changing**

Technology is always changing and with it the tools used to create it. Being a developer means that you are always learning new skills and new programing languages so you will never feel stagnated. 

**Coding is creative**

I see the role of developer as that of an artist. Like a painter that uses the canvas, brush and color to create something new, a developer creates something new using the computer as canvas and code as the tool to bring to life websites, apps and platforms. The possibilities are endless and only limited by your imagination.

**Coding is the present and the future**

Ever since the invention of the PC, and even more since the smartphone revolution, technology has been an integral part of modern life. We use it all day, everyday. Being able to code affords you the opportunity to touch people’s lives and hopefully make them better. As we progress towards an ever more tech-filled future, developer skills will increasingly be in demand. We could even see programming languages become more valuable than traditional spoken languages.

**Coding is being part of a community**

The people you work with are just as important as the work you do. Web developers not only usually work in a team, but they also have countless online communities at their fingertips. The online community for developers is huge, and if used to the fullest can be a source of technical support and a meeting place with like-minded people. Online communities are a great resource that you can gain a lot from, not to mention what you can give back.

**Coding gives you freedom and flexibility** 

Learning code is learning a high demand trade that can be done from anywhere- all you need is a computer and internet access. You can be your own boss or work in a company. You can work from home, an office or even the coffee shop down the block.
