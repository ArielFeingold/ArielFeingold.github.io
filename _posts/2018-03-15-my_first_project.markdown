I have been learning code fo almost two months now and boy was it a whirlwind. Learning code is very much like learning a new language. You learn how to speak to your computer and tell it what to do. If something gets lost in translation then it will not understand you and won’t cooperate…

during these weeks I have been learning the words and how to make sentences and now it was time to take it to the next level and write an assay, or in this case- my very first program. This was very exciting to me, the thing that draw me to programming  the most was how it allows you to create new things and this would be my first opportunity to do so.

The assignment was to build an app that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source.
 I decided to create a “Headphone Buyer’s Guide” to help the user find the best headphone for him. You can check it out here:

- Walkthrough video

This project can be intimidating at first. The possibilities are endless, how to decide what to do and how to go about it?
In my opinion the most important thing is to have a solid work process to help you stayed focused and achieve your goals. Here is mine, I hope it helps other new programers like me.


##### Step one - Choose
You need to decide what will your program actually do. This step might seem obvious but it is crucial to think about that in advance and set yourself up for success. I chose headphones because it is something that interests me and I have an understanding on what information to present and how.
 
##### Step two - Plan 

Before I even touched the keyboard I planned how I wanted my program to behave. I drew (on a legal pad!!) a tree diagram of the different options and flow that I want my program to have. This really helped me to envision how the app would work. Don’t worry about if you can code it or not, design your optimal app. Later the plan can be adjusted.

##### Step three-  Code
my coding process can be divided into three stages-

1. I started coding only focusing on the skeleton, basically translating the flow that I drew before and writing a program that takes the user through all the stages of the program. I didn’t deal with the logic behind it or object relations at this point. Whenever I needed input that would come from another source I put place holders so I can execute my code without braking. 

2. Only after I had the program function did I start going into the logic. First I built the scraping methods and after that figured how to integrate them with the other objects.
 
3. The last stage was refactoring and abstracting my program by creating helper methods so it is more flexible and the code is dry(er).

The advantage I found in this coding method is that it is easier to deal with errors and how to fix them. That’s because you are building your program from the ground up, every time adding another piece to the puzzle. i made sure to run my code often to see that it still works so when it broke I had a good idea where the problem is.

In conclusion, project was definitely challenging and really required me to use all the material I learned in the past 6 weeks. it was hard at times but the end result - a program that I built (and published on Rubygems) was absolutely worth it!
