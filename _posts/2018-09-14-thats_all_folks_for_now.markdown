Finally, it’s done! It was a process, but my final assessment project is ready. 

The project called for creating a frontend React app using a Ruby on Rails backend API. For the API I used the rails new –API command which creates a leaner version of Rails aimed to only used as a data point for a frontend client. I also used react-create-app to build the basic tree file. I have to say that these type of project builders are a blessing as they both save you time creating everything manually and also gives you a basic structure on which to build your program.

I have to say this program was challenging. There were some of features that I wanted to include in my app that we didn’t go through in the curriculum. One example for that is the JWT authentication process. It was a challenge to figure it out drawing from many sources and a lot of trial and error, but that is what coding is all about- figuring it out! 

When you build a new program or feature there isn’t one way of doing things. Most times you will know what you want to accomplish but only have a starting idea how to get there. Programing is about research, trial and error and figuring it out by yourself but mostly by looking online for others who tried to tackle the same thing (or similar) and learning from the answers they got and the solutions they found.

My project is finished but not done! I have many more features that I would like to include and I would definitely revisit this to add more features.
